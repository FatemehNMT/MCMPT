**Following my previous dissertation — Multi-Person Localization and Tracking Using Dynamic Bayesian Networks and Hierarchical Data Association — which was primarily based on statistical modeling and MATLAB implementations, I decided to extend my research direction toward deep-learning-based and more creative approaches using Python.**

**Building upon the novelties introduced in my earlier work, I have now expanded the framework to both Single-Camera and Multi-Camera Multi-Person Tracking scenarios.**
This includes rethinking the data association pipeline, improving robustness under occlusion, and introducing new ideas that generalize across camera views.

**Numerical results and video demonstrations are currently being generated and will be added soon.**
Below, I have listed the main novelties and methodological contributions of this line of research.
The core scripts, refined codebase, and final outputs will be uploaded shortly.
